A movie description website

The search bar can be used to search your movie (which will display results as you type).
Among the search results click on the movie for which you need to get the details which will open a movie page.
There is a my Fvorites icon at the top right corner of the site which displays your favorite movies (even if you refresh the site, you can view the
added movies).
